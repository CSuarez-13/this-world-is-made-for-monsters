<p class="text-primary m-10 text-lg">In <span class="italic">"This World Is Made for Monsters,"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>)
     we encounter a portrayal of the townspeople's initial fascination and acceptance of the alien visitors. 
     The story captures moments of genuine connection and empathy between humans and aliens, where 
     differences are celebrated rather than feared. Despite initial confusion and panic, there is a sense 
     of openness and receptivity to the unknown. </p>

    <div class="grid flex-grow card rounded-box place-items-center"><p class="text-primary mr-10 ml-10 text-lg">As the narrator 
        reflects on the events of that day, he recalls the children's excitement and curiosity in the face of 
        the unknown: <span class="italic">"We children got on our bikes and, in the spirit of generosity such an event inspires, 
        abandoned cliques to share rides with kids we wouldn't usually play with"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>). As the children rush 
        to the landing site, their eagerness to engage with the aliens reflects a natural curiosity and lack of 
        prejudice. This initial response sets the stage for moments of genuine connection and empathy that 
        unfold throughout the narrative.</p></div>

<p class="text-primary m-10 text-lg">One such moment occurs when little Amy welcomes the aliens into her home 
    with open arms. Her innocence and warmth break down barriers, bridging the divide between human and 
    alien. The narrator describes this moment: <span class="italic">"Together they skipped to the house where Mrs. Belten opened 
    the door and followed them inside as though it were an ordinary day"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>). This quote emphasizes Amy's 
    open-hearted acceptance of the aliens and her willingness to treat them as friends rather than 
    strangers.</p>

    <div class="grid flex-grow card rounded-box place-items-center"><p class="text-primary mr-10 ml-10 text-lg">The aliens' interaction 
        with Amy and her dog, Angus, demonstrates a mutual understanding and affection that transcends 
        language and cultural differences. A crucial moment in the story occurs when Angus, the dog, tries to 
        leave with the aliens. The narrator observes: <span class="italic">"Unexpectedly, Argus ran out of the 
            field and bounded up the stairs and through the open door after them, but before anything could be 
            done about it, the dog returned, accompanied by one of the large aliens who paused to give the 
            eager animal an enthusiastic rub"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>). This moment makes the reader realize that the aliens 
            were perceived as friendly by those who were not blinded by prejudice. These moments of connection 
            highlight the capacity for empathy to foster meaningful relationships across species boundaries.</p></div>

<p class="text-primary m-10 text-lg">Additionally, the description of Amy in the future as someone who 
    promotes interstellar equality, and the granddaughter Tess's reaction and shame towards offensive 
    behavior, demonstrate care and welcoming attitudes towards the aliens. The narrator reflects on Amy's 
    advocacy: <span class="italic">"She still lives on the farm where she has set up an amazing array of telescopes and s
    targazing equipment. She has lived there all these years, a recluse, promoting her radicalized agenda 
    of interstellar equality and such nonsense through the Internet, spitting into the wind, I would say, 
    except that--for some reason--her bizarre beliefs have gained traction with this younger generation"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>). 
    This quote highlights Amy's commitment to promoting equality and understanding between humans and 
    aliens, despite societal resistance. Similarly, Tess's reaction to offensive behavior demonstrates a 
    sense of empathy and compassion towards the aliens: <span class="italic">"Why, just the other day, Tess told me she didn't 
    want to go to the festival. I was stunned. 'Why not?' I asked. 'I don't want to drink out of the alien's 
    body,' she said. 'I don't want to eat its finger. I don't want to be mean'"</span> (<a href="/references" class="link link-info">Rickert, 2020</a>). This quote emphasizes
     Tess's refusal to participate in activities that disrespect or dehumanize the aliens, highlighting her 
     commitment to empathy and inclusivity.</p>
